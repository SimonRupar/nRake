h2. Summary

Fed up with XML based builds that are hard to maintain, refactor and extend? Rather than trying to fix this with more xml and community tasks, or re-invent the wheel, lets use rake. Rake is a mature build system developed by the ruby community which can be applied equally well in the .NET world.

nRake provides a template C# .NET project with a standardised directory tree, a Rake build, templated app and web configs for different environments and Continuous Integration server sample config files.

h2. How to use
* Choose your version:
  ** "nRake with Iron Ruby for .NET 4":http://github.com/jcrisp/nRake/ (recommended for .NET 4)
  ** "nRake with Iron Ruby for .NET 2/3.5":http://github.com/jcrisp/nRake/tree/IronRuby2 (recommended if you're not on .NET 4)
  ** "nRake with bundled Ruby 1.9":http://github.com/jcrisp/nRake/tree/Ruby1.9 (legacy)
* Git clone or Download nRake as a Zip 
* Rename PlaceHolder app and tests to reflect your project
* Run rake.bat in the root of the project, to make sure everything still builds
* Start developing :-)

Also nRake uses the "Albacore Gem":http://albacorebuild.net/ for .NET build tasks. Documentation on "Albacore tasks here":http://wiki.github.com/derickbailey/Albacore/
